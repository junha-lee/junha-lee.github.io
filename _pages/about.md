* Name : JUNHA, LEE

## Research Interests
My technical interests are divided among three areas : (a) Artificial intelligence in
embedded systems, (b) IoT Platform with Artificial Intelligence, and (c) Business
modeling with enhanced IoT platform. I would like to study the vitalization of the
sharing economy through the connection of idle resources.
